## Difference in syntax between js and node js

**JavaScript (JS)** is a *language*. **Node.js** is a *runtime environment* that allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser (e.g., on a server).

So the core language syntax is the same â€” but what differs is:

The **execution context** (browser vs server)

The **APIs available**
```text
Browser JS gives you:

  DOM APIs (document, querySelector, etc.)
  fetch, 
  localStorage, 
  sessionStorage


Node.js gives you:

  File system (fs)
  HTTP server (http)
  Path utilities (path)
  Buffer, streams, crypto, etc.

```

The **module system**
