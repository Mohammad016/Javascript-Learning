## Difference in syntax between js and node js

**JavaScript (JS)** is a *language*. **Node.js** is a *runtime environment* that allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser (e.g., on a server).

So the core language syntax is the same â€” but what differs is:

The **execution context** (browser vs server)

The **APIs available**

The **module system**
