**How It Works (Conceptual Flow)**
---
	1.	User fills out the HTML form on your static site.
	2.	Form data is sent to a backend server via POST request.
	3.	Backend:
	    •	Receives the data.
	    •	Formats it (e.g., saves as JSON, Markdown, or directly edits an HTML/JS file).
	    •	Uses Git commands or GitHub API to:
	    •	Commit the change.
	    •	Push it to your GitHub repository.

 

** What You Need**
---
	1.	HTML Form (frontend) – A basic form for user input.
	2.	Backend Server (Node.js, Python, etc.) – Handles submission.
	3.	GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) – Used by backend to push changes.
	4.	Git Installed on Server (optional) – If using native Git commands.
	5.	Webhook or GitHub API – To commit and push via REST API or use git CLI.
